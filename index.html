    <h1>college life story</h1>
    <p>
                College life is known as one of the most memorable years of ones life. It is entirely different from school
        life. College life exposes us to new experiences and things that we were not familiar with earlier. For some
        people, college life means enjoying life to the fullest and partying hard. While for others, it is time to get
        serious about their career and study thoroughly for a brighter future.
              Nonetheless, college life remains a memorable time for all of us. Not everyone is lucky enough to experience
        college life. People do not get the chance to go to college due to various reasons. Sometimes they do not have a
        strong financial background to do so while other times they have other responsibilities to fulfill. The ones who
        have had a college life always wish to turn back time to live it all once again.
        The Transition from School Life to College Life
              College life is a big transition from school life. We go through a lot of changes when we enter college. Our
        schools were a safe place where we had grown up and spent half our lives. The transition to college is so sudden
        that youre no longer protected by your teachers and friends of your school time.
             College life poses a lot of challenges in front of you. You are now in a place full of unfamiliar faces where
        you need to mingle in. It teaches us to socialize and form opinions of our own. In college, students learn their
        free will and they go on to become more confident and composed.
